# NM_Matrix_Shortest_Path
This is an efficient algorithm to construct shortest path between any pair vertices of facebook graph. 

Abstract
In the study of network optimization, finding the shortest path minimizing time/distance/cost from a source node to a
destination node is one of the fundamental problems. Our focus here is to find the shortest path between any pair of
nodes in a given undirected unweighted simple graph with the help of the sequence of powers of neighbourhood
matrices.
